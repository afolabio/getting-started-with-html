HTML is the heart of the web<br> 
Text – what we see<br>
Markup – what it looks like<br>
References – to other documents<br>
Links –to other pages<br>
HTML Markup is set up like "<Name> Contents </Name>"<br> 
Also learned some basic commands like <b>BOLD</b> and <em> ITALIICS</em> as well as being introduced to "inline" versus "block" commands.<br> Block commands build a box around the content whereas inline commands like IMG will display in the line of the text.
